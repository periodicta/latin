# Introduction

Latin was the language of the ancient Romans and is often still studied today and influences many modern disciplines, such as law. The original language is an inflected language where the usage and meaning of particular words relies largely on their ending, affixed to a predetermined root. Although the word order of Latin is not fixed and can be changed at will, a Subject-Object-Verb order is common, unlike English's more common Subject-Verb-Object.

> Bob threw the ball.

In the above example, `Bob` is our subject (performing the action), `threw` is our verb (the action), and `the ball` is our object (having the action performed on it). Latin might write this as:

> Bob the ball threw.

since word order isn't fixed in latin; you would be able to understand the meaning of the sentence based on the endings that the words would have.

**NOTA BENE**

Examples in this guide like the ones above will usually be in block quotes, while notes may be formatted like this! Fun fact: "Nota bene" means "note well" in Latin!

Latin consists of several parts of speech that each follow different rules: **Nouns**, **Verbs**, **Adjectives**, **Prepositions**, **Adverbs**, and **Pronouns**. This guide will go over all of them one by one before we begin sentence construction.

In Latin, words are defined by their **lexical entry**, a set of words which explains everything necessary to create all their forms.

# Nouns

Nouns represent *things*, often physical, tangible objects, but sometimes more abstract concepts. Nouns in Latin are split into 5 different categories known as **declensions**. The only difference between these categories are how the nouns are **declined**, i.e, how their endings are formed. Each noun has 3 primary characteristics: **gender**, **number**, and **case**.

The general lexical entry of a noun has the following form: nom. sg., nom. pl. (gender): *meaning*. For example, the Latin word for water is

> aqua, aquae (f.): *water*

In the above lexical entry, `aqua` and `aquae` are the nominative singular and plural, respectively, while `f.` denotes that it is feminine in gender and in italics it is indicated that it means `water` in English.

## Characteristics of Nouns

The 3 primary characteristics of a Latin noun are **gender**, **number**, and **case**. Number and case change the ending of a noun while gender is intrinsic to every noun and will affect the words that modify it.

### Gender

Every noun in Latin has one of three genders: **masculine**, **feminine**, or **neuter**, abbreviated as `m.`, `f.`, or `n.`, respectively. The gender of a noun has no bearing on how it is declined, but rather affects how it will be modified by adjectives and pronouns. Although there are no hard and fast definitions for which nouns have which genders, there are certain patterns; for example, abstract nouns like <span class="tooltip" markdown="1">libertas<span class="tooltiptext">libertas, libertatis (f.): *liberty*</span></span> are often feminine. In addition, the grammatical gender of people almost always refers to their correct gender, regardless of the declension of their noun, such as  <span class="tooltip" markdown="1">Achilles<span class="tooltiptext">Achilles, Achillis (m.): *Achilles*</span></span>.

### Number

Number in latin simply refers to whether a noun is **singular** or **plural**, abbreviated as `sg.` or `pl.` respectively. When a noun is singular, there is only one of them, while if it is plural there are more than one of them. For example, the sg. noun <span class="tooltip" markdown="1">liber<span class="tooltiptext">liber, libri (m.): *book*</span></span> refers to a single book, while the pl. <span class="tooltip" markdown="1">libri<span class="tooltiptext">liber, libri (m.): *book*</span></span> refers to multiple books.

### Case

Finally, the case of a noun defines its usage in the sentence. There are 5 major cases in Latin: the **nominative**, **genitive**, **dative**, **accusative**, and **ablative**, abbreviated as `nom.`, `gen.` `dat.`, `acc.`, and `abl.`, respectively. There are also a few much less frequent cases, the **vocative** (`voc.`), and the **locative** (`loc.`). The form of a noun will tell you what case the noun is in, which will tell you its role in the sentence:

- Nom.: subject of the sentence
- Gen.: possessive
- Dat.: indirect object
- Acc.: direct object
- Abl.: variety of uses, including object of prepositions
- Voc.: direct address
- Loc.: location of an object

These are only *some* of the many usages of these cases, we will go into more detailed usage later on.
