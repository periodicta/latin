# Introduction

Latin was the language of the ancient Romans and is often still studied today and influences many modern disciplines, such as law. The original language is an inflected language where the usage and meaning of particular words relies largely on their ending, affixed to a predetermined root. Although the word order of Latin is not fixed and can be changed at will, a Subject-Object-Verb order is common, unlike English's more common Subject-Verb-Object.

> Bob threw the ball.

In the above example, `Bob` is our subject (performing the action), `threw` is our verb (the action), and `the ball` is our object (having the action performed on it). Latin might write this as:

> Bob the ball threw.

since word order isn't fixed in latin; you would be able to understand the meaning of the sentence based on the endings that the words would have.

Examples in this guide will often use blockquotes as shown above for examples. Notes might be styled more like this one. Fun fact: "Nota bene" is latin for "Note well"!

Latin consists of several parts of speech that each follow different rules: **Nouns**, **Verbs**, **Adjectives**, **Prepositions**, **Adverbs**, and **Pronouns**. This guide will go over all of them one by one before we begin sentence construction.

# Nouns

Latin nouns are split into 5 different categories known as **declensions**. The only difference between these categories are how the nouns are **declined**, i.e, how their endings are formed. Each noun has 3 primary characteristics: **gender**, **number**, and **case**. Two of those, number and case, affect the ending of a noun, while gender is intrinsic to all nouns and will affect how it is modified by adjectives later on.
