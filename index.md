# Introduction

Latin was the language of the ancient Romans and is often still studied today and influences many modern disciplines, such as law. The original language is an inflected language where the usage and meaning of particular words relies largely on their ending, affixed to a predetermined root. Although the word order of Latin is not fixed and can be changed at will, a Subject-Object-Verb order is common, unlike English's more common Subject-Verb-Object.

> Bob threw the ball

In the above example, `Bob` is our subject (performing the action), `threw` is our verb (the action), and `the ball` is our object (having the action performed on it). Latin might write this as:

> Bob the ball threw

since word order isn't fixed in latin; you would be able to understand the meaning of the sentence based on the endings that the words would have.
