# Latin Grammar

Latin was the language of the ancient Romans and is often still studied today and influences many modern disciplines, such as law. The original language is an inflected language where the usage and meaning of particular words relies largely on their ending, affixed to a predetermined root. Although the word order of Latin is not fixed and can be changed at will, a Subject-Object-Verb order is common, unlike English's more common Subject-Verb-Object. (For example: Bob threw the ball.)
